# Text Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This repository contains code for performing text classification using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The code preprocesses text data, trains a KNN classifier, evaluates its performance, and makes predictions on new data.

## Introduction

Text classification is a common task in natural language processing (NLP), where the goal is to assign predefined categories or labels to text documents based on their content. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple yet effective algorithm for text classification, where the class label of a new document is determined by the majority class among its K nearest neighbors in the feature space.

This code snippet demonstrates a complete workflow for text classification with KNN. It includes text preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization, followed by feature extraction using CountVectorizer. The extracted features are then used to train a KNN classifier, which is evaluated on a test set. Additionally, predictions are made on new, unseen data to classify text documents.

## Setup

To run the code, you need to have Python installed along with the following dependencies:

- numpy
- pandas
- nltk
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas nltk scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/text-classification-knn.git
cd text-classification-knn
```

2. Run the Python script:

```bash
python text_classification_knn.py
```

This will execute the code, performing text classification using the KNN algorithm.
